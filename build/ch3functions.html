    <h1>Functions Concept</h1>
    <p>Openn your console log to see MAGIC!</p>

    <p>Defining a function : A function definition is just a regular variable definition where the value given to the variable happens to be a function. <br>
      Sample of function that has parameter and has got no parameter
      <em>Check console log : </em>
    </p>

    <p>Parameter and scopes : <strong>Important property of functions : </strong>
      Variables that created inside of them are local to the functions!
    </p>

    <p>Nested Scope : <strong>Things to remember, Functions can be created inside other functions</strong>
    </p>
    <em>Check the console log to see the example of <strong>nested functions</strong></em>

    <p>Function as values : Function variables usually simply act as names for a specific piece of the program.</p>

    <p>Declaration Notation : var square = function(){} is equal to function square(){}</p>
    <p><strong>Do NOT</strong> put function inside a conditional if block
    Eg : <br>
      <em>Check console log : </em>
    </p>

    <p>The Call stack</p>
    <p>
      It will be helpful to take a closer look at the way control flows through functions. Here is a simple program that makes a few function calls:
    </p>
    <div>
      function greet(who){ <br>
        console.log("Hello " + who); <br>
      }<br>
      greet("Harry"); <br>
      console.log("Bye");

    </div>

    <p><strong>Flow of control schematically like this </strong></p>

    <p>
      A run through this program goes roughly like this: the call to greet causes control to jump to the start of that function (line 2). <br>
      It calls console.log (a built-in browser function), which takes control, does its job, and then returns control to line 2.  <br>
      Then it reaches the end of the greet function, so it returns to the place that called it, at line 4. <br>
      The line after that calls console.log again.
    </p>
    <ol>We could show the flow of control schematically like this:
      <li>top</li>
      <li>greet</li>
      <li>console.log</li>
      <li>greet</li>
      <li>top</li>
      <li>console.log</li>
      <li>top</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Optional Arguments definitions : JavaScript is extremely broad-minded about the number of arguments you pass to a function.
      <br> If you pass too many, the extra ones are ignored. If you pass too few, the missing parameters simply get assigned the value undefined.
    </p>
